        Since the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, many countries have become increasingly reliant on fossil fuels for energy. This has allowed us to make advances in technology and human comfort. However, burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. These gases stay in the atmosphere and absorb heat which would otherwise escape the earth, contributing to global warming. The global temperature is expected to rise between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius by 2100, a significant and rapid change which could have devastating effects.
      </p>
      <p class = "my-text">
        In response to this issue, a few international initiatives have been proposed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and slow climate change. One initiative is the Kyoto protocol, which entered into force in February 2005 and set emission reduction targets for 37 industrialised countries, including Australia and the US. Another is the Paris agreement, which came into force in 2016. 
      </p>
      <!--- <p class = "my-text">
        The plot on the left shows that Australia's CO2 emissions per capita is high compared to other countries, being over three times the global average. Since the implementation of these global agreements, though, our emissions have been decreasing.

        Temperature change caused by global warming can be observed in historical data. The graph on the right allows for exploration of average daily minimum and maximum temperature over time. The trend of minimum and maximum temperatures rising can be observed in all months, but is particularly egregious in summer.   
      </p>

      <p class="my-text">
        Take January as an example. We see that the minimum daily temperature is around 12 or 13 degrees Celsius from 1945-1950, but from 2010 onwards is always over 14°C. From 2005 onwards, the average maximum temperature is over 26°C every year except 2011 and 2021. However, from 1944-1960, this only occurs around half the time. 
      </p>

      <p class="my-text">
        There are several outliers in this small sample. However, the trend of maximum and minimum temperatures rising carries across most months.

        The graph on the left shows predictions made by the CSIRO about annual mean temperature in Australia.

      <p class = "my-text">
        Notice that the temperature on land is predicted to rise more than temperature in the ocean. This is because land has a lower heat capacity than water, meaning it takes less heat to raise its temperature by 1°C.
      </p>
      <p class = "my-text">
        There are many different climate change models which account for various scenarios. The scenario in the chart is called RCP 4.5. It assumes that radiative forcing will stabilise at 4.5 W/m^2 by 2100. Radiative forcing is the difference between the energy entering Earth from the sun and the energy leaving Earth. By assuming this will stabilise, this scenario assumes that we do employ strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as an intermediate scenario.
      </p>
      <p class = "my-text">
        Another model which compares to RCP 4.5 is RCP 8.5. This model is considered a worst-case scenario and assumes greenhouse gas emissions continue on historical trends. It is considered an unlikely scenario, as many countries are already slowing emissions (see first graph). While the RCP 4.5 chart shows temperatures rising by roughly 2°C by 2080-2100, RCP 8.5 predicts a mean rise of over 4°C.
      </p>
      <p class = "my-text">
        The difference between these models highlights the importance of reducing emissions and setting global targets.

        The graph on the right plots historical rainfall measured at the weather station in Oakleigh, VIC. Rainfall is a weather attribute that we expect will be affected by climate change. The changes will be different in different parts of Australia. In southern mainland Australia, winter and spring rainfall is expected to decrease. In Tasmania, increases in winter rainfall are projected. Only minor changes are expected in northern and eastern Australia.
      </p>
      <p class="my-text">
        The graph also shows historical droughts. The millenium drought is considered to be the first major Australian drought to interact with climate change. Time in drought is projected to increase over southern Australia, and moreover, the drought is coupled with high temperatures. This leads to harsher fire weather.

           Here we can explore predictions for fire danger rating, made by the CSIRO. The size of each circle shows the days per year that each location is expected to have a certain fire danger rating. The ratings shown are High, Very High, Severe and Extreme. Note that these have been updated as of September 2022.
      </p>
      <p class="my-text">
        We again have the two models of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. It is clear that RCP 8.5 is the worse scenario and leads to greater fire danger, with more days per year having a fire danger rating of high and above. In both scenarios, the risk increases over time. This is particularly clear for areas which already have a heightened fire danger risk, such as central Australia; however, increases are apparent in Victoria and New South Wales also.
      </p>
      <p class="my-text">
        The difference between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 models highlights the need for Australia to take action on climate change. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we are able to better protect our country from bushfires and droughts.
